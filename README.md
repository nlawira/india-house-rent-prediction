# India's House Prices Prediction

## Preface
This self-initiated project improves my submitted project for the CB4247 Statistics & Computational Inference to Big Data module at NTU. After my initial project was graded, I sought my lecturer's feedback and incorporated it into this version of this project. This repository contains my project's code and report (**To be uploaded soon**) and showcases my machine learning, data analysis, and pre-processing, Python, and report writing skills.

## Project Overview
This self-initiated project aims to:
- Apply data analysis and visualization techniques to analyze a real-world dataset.
- Train machine learning algorithms on the chosen dataset, including Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
- Conduct ANOVA and residual analysis to test the validity of Ordinary Least Squares Regression assumptions.
- Evaluate each algorithm's performance via metrics, including mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R2.
- Identify critical variables via feature importance.
- Develop the most accurate model for the chosen dataset by combining high-performing algorithms.

**This file serves as a short summary of my report.**
My report will soon be uploaded into this repository, detailing my project's aim, background, exploratory analysis, regression, modeling, discussions, and conclusion. Thank you very much for your patience!
