# India's House Prices Prediction

## Preface
This self-initiated project improves my submitted project for the CB4247 Statistics & Computational Inference to Big Data module at NTU. After my initial project was graded, I sought my lecturer's feedback and incorporated it into this version of this project. This repository contains my project's code and report and showcases my machine learning, data analysis, pre-processing, Python, and report-writing skills.

## Project Overview
This self-initiated project aims to:
- Apply data analysis and visualization techniques to analyze a real-world dataset.
- Train machine learning algorithms on the chosen dataset, including Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
- Conduct ANOVA and residual analysis to test the validity of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression assumptions.
- Evaluate each algorithm's performance via metrics, including mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R2.
- Identify critical variables via feature importance.
- Develop a robust and accurate model by combining high-performing algorithms.

This project used a dataset containing house prices in India for OLS regression analysis and training various machine learning models. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset) in Kaggle. Data pre-processing and thorough preliminary analysis were conducted before regression and training, removing outliers to reduce noise in the data and feature engineering to preserve information in the dataset.
